# zen.dotz
Simple & subtle analogue watch with bold hands and dots. Aimed to be easy to see at a quick glance.

Features:
- Month & date
- Battery slider (dot moves from right to left, shows remaining battery)
- Bluetooth disconnect alert (vibrates and fill the black dot in the centre - 3rd screenshot)

Credits:
This watch uses the "absolute symmetry" idea from "Zen For Steel" (Richard Gilbert), hence the name; and the bold hands from "ONE" (Bert Freudenberg)
